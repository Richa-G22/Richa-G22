I am a full stack developer with expertise in JavaScript, Python, React, Redux, Node.js, Express and Flask. I have recently up-skilled myself by taking an year-long rigorous course in full stack development at App Academy. Though I always enjoyed working on backend and data related technologies, the boot camp with App Academy gave me an opportunity to explore front end development. While working through the boot camp, I gradually became passionate for creating user friendly and performant websites. 

Prior to joining App Academy, I took a career break to raise my young kids. In my previous stint of 7.5 years as a software engineer, I developed and maintained software for clients in retail and insurance sector using mainframe technologies like COBOL, JCL, CICS, DB2. 

I have experience of working on traditional waterfall, AGILE and onshore / offshore based delivery models. I am experienced in engineering leadership, people management, project planning, stakeholder management, prioritization, conflict resolution and mentorship.

I recently graduated from App Academy and am very excited to start the next chapter of my career !! 
I am open to opportunities in frontend/backend development.

### My projects - 
1. <a href=https://clickr-qv53.onrender.com/>Clickr</a> - 
              Clickr was developed for educational purpose at App Academy, keeping in mind the famous photo sharing website "Flickr". It aims at providing the user with a similar experience of sharing and exploring captivating images.

2. <a href=https://booktable.onrender.com/>BookTable</a> -
              BookTable was also developed for educational purpose. The functionality is loosely inspired by table reservation website 'Open Table'. The website allows users to view, select a restaurant of choice and to reserve a table there.
